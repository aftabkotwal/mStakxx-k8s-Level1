Creating a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Compute Engine
You need a Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled.
Install gcloud as a part of the Google Cloud SDK.
Enable the Compute Engine Instance Group Manager API in the Google Cloud developers console.
Make sure that gcloud is set to use the Google Cloud Platform project you want. 
example: root@LAPTOP-TMBJEORH:~# gcloud config list project
[core]
project = micro-services-215711
Make sure you have credentials for GCloud by running gcloud auth login.
